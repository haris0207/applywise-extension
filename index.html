<h1>Extension Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how the Applywise Extension ("the Extension") collects, uses, and protects user data. By using our Extension, you agree to the terms of this policy.</p>

<h2>1. Data Collection and Use</h2>
<p>The Applywise Extension is designed to help you analyze and manage your job applications. To fulfill this purpose, the Extension collects and processes the following user data:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Authentication Information:</strong> We collect your name, email address, and profile picture from your Google account when you sign in. This information is used to create and manage your personal user account on your local Applywise dashboard (<code>http://localhost:3000</code>). Your authentication status is maintained using browser cookies.</li>
  <li><strong>Website Content:</strong> We collect job descriptions from websites like LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor. This data, along with your CV text, is sent to Google's Generative Language API to perform an analysis and generate a tailored CV and cover letter. The URL of the job post may also be collected for saving to your dashboard.</li>
  <li><strong>User Activity:</strong> We track activity within the Extension (e.g., button clicks) to perform functions like retrieving job descriptions, saving applications, and navigating to your dashboard.</li>
  <li><strong>Job Application Data:</strong> We store job application data you choose to save, including company name, job title, job description, your tailored CV, and notes, on your local Applywise dashboard.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Justification for Permissions</h2>
<p>The Extension requires the following permissions to function as intended:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> Allows the Extension to interact with the currently active tab to retrieve job description content.</li>
  <li><strong>scripting:</strong> Allows the Extension to inject scripts into pages to retrieve job descriptions that aren’t fully exposed in the DOM.</li>
  <li><strong>tabs:</strong> Allows the Extension to create new tabs, specifically to open your Applywise dashboard.</li>
  <li><strong>cookies:</strong> Allows the Extension to send authentication cookies to your local Applywise dashboard (<code>http://localhost:3000</code>) to verify your identity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, <code>host_permissions</code> are used for:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/*</code> — to analyze job descriptions and CVs with Google's API.</li>
  <li><code>http://localhost:3000/*</code> — to fetch and save data in your local dashboard.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Remote Code Justification</h2>
<p>The Extension uses remote code solely for secure API calls:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Applywise Dashboard:</strong> (<code>http://localhost:3000</code>) to retrieve your saved CV and save new applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Google’s Generative Language API:</strong> (<code>https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/*</code>) to analyze job descriptions and CVs.</li>
</ul>
<p>No remote code executes arbitrary instructions on your computer.</p>

<h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell or transfer user data to third parties for purposes unrelated to the Extension's core functionality. Job descriptions and CV text are only sent to Google's Generative Language API when you initiate the "Analyze" function.</p>

<h2>5. Data Retention and Security</h2>
<p>Your data is stored securely on your local Applywise dashboard under your control. We use secure authentication practices to protect your data.</p>

<h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us.</p>
